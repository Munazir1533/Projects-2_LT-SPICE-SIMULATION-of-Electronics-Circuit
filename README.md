# Projects-2_LT-SPICE-SIMULATION-of-Electronics-Circuit
                                      `ABSTRACT`
This project report presents an LT SPICE simulation. LT SPICE is a SPICE-based analog
electronic circuit simulator computer software, produced by semiconductor manufacturer 
Analog Device. It is the widely distributed and used SPICE software in the industry. It is 
freeware.
LTspice provides schematics capture to enter an electronic schematic for an electronics 
circuit, an enhanced SPICE-type analog electronic circuit simulator, and a waveform viewer to 
show the results of the simulation. Circuit simulation analysis based on transient, noise, AC, 
DC, transfer function, and DC operating point can be performed and plotted as well as Fourier 
analysis.
LTspice does not generate printed circuit board (PCB), but netlist can be exported to PCB 
layout software.
LTspice is used in many users in the field including radio frequency electronics, power 
electronics, audio electronics, digital electronics, and other disciplines.
LTspice is easy-to-use circuit designing software and can be used for the analysis of any type of 
circuit. It is less time-consuming and all circuits can be executed accuratelyItâ€™s cheaper than 
buying a lot of real parts and a real signal generator and oscilloscope. 
In the simulation, the values of components can be changed. It can save time by designing a 
prototype of a circuit, by simulation we can check the behaviors of the circuits and then 
performed on the hardware.
